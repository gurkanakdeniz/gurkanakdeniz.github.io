<strong>Gürkan Akdeniz</strong>

Hi, I’m Gürkan. I’ve been interested in new technologies since i was a child and i wanted this to be my future job when i grow up. I feel free when i write code and i like it. I’m trying to improve my skills and i chose Computer Engineering as my job to have more ideas and learn different areas. To find and get to know new technologies i used different platforms to develop my university projects. I am an active Gnu Linux user for a long time, but lately at university i have been in a project about E-commerce on .Net platform and used NopCommerce. After graduation i am working as a Java Developer and the moment also develop new codes on Spring Framework.
