# Rest API Playground [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gurkanakdeniz/kicket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gurkanakdeniz/kicket)

# Why we did that?

> We realized developers struggling to develop small applications while trying to setup other language environment then their core development language. Our main objective is to let developers share their work with other developers who use other languages using rest API.

# What's happening on inside?

### Let's look at step by step;

> When user want to deploy API

###### Request hit to our '/create' endpoint with the platform chosen by the user. kicket forward the request to related application server. If related application server doesn't send any error to kicket, kicket insert user's API platform and API UUID that generated by the related application server. In this way, we validate user's API platform. Finally, we return the UUID to user to call their API.

> When user want to run exist API

###### Request hit to our '/run' endpoint with the UUID. Firstly,kicket check this UUID in MongoDB, if kicket find this UUID, kicket get the platform information to forward the request. After request forward to related platform, request have 5 seconds to return some response. API's response or timeout response return to user directly.

### How can I build & run the project locally?

1. You can clone only [kicket](https://github.com/gurkanakdeniz/kicket) repository.

   - You need to MongoDB and Node JS(> v12.5.0)
   - In this case, you need to change .env file.
   - Your .env file look like;

     ```
     JAVA_API=https://kicket-java.herokuapp.com
     NODE_API=https://kicket-node.herokuapp.com
     PYTHON_API=https://kicket-python.herokuapp.com
     PHP_API=https://kicket-php.herokuapp.com/index.php/Api
     HTML_API=https://kicket-html.herokuapp.com
     GO_API=https://kicket-go.herokuapp.com
     MONGO=mongodb://localhost:27017/execode
     ```

   - Type your terminal npm install & npm start.

2. You can clone [kicket](https://github.com/gurkanakdeniz/kicket) repository and all dependent projects(repository links are below). In this case, you don't touch any files just type your terminal npm install then, npm start.

### In Progress Main Functionality

- All programming language supports get exist API with UUID and update.
